# Starting with Windows
Something to consider with Windows is that, at a general level, the Operative system is made for Users and not for Administators -which is the role you tend to want as a developer-. Fear not. With a few tweaks, we can make sure we have our terminal up to date for working with Github. The other apps, such as anaconda and Pycharm, will be launched not from the terminal but as an app alone but that can actually be practical.

There are three main things you need to do:
- Having a decent terminal (bash based)
- Having Anaconda for creating [virtual environments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIB7IZFCE_k)
- Launching [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) from Anaconda or an IDE like [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/edu-products/download/#section=idea)

## Decent terminal --> Installing Git (will be extended in the Lecture on Friday)
It can be done by downloading the following [file](https://git-scm.com/download/win). You probably have a 64-bit computer but make sure to [double check](https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/21726/how-do-i-know-if-im-running-32-bit-or-64-bit-windows-answers/)

## Github Desktop
A great tool to handle git repositories in Windows. You can install it [here](https://desktop.github.com/). It will all make sense tomorrow :)

## Anaconda
[Tutorial](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/) to download, and customizable installation instructions

## Jupyter Notebook or Pycharm
- Jupyter is already installed with Anaconda. You can install [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/edu-products/download/#section=idea) here.
